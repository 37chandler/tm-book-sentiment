    "# Sentiment Analysis of Plots\n",
    "In this notebook we reprise an [analysis](https://infogram.com/blog/scientists-use-big-data-to-discover-6-basic-emotional-story-arcs/) discussed in _Everybody Lies_. In this chapter Stephens-Davidowitz details an approach to measuring plots, looking at sentiment across a book. He posits six main plots:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Rags to Riches (rise)\n",
    "1. Riches to Rags (fall)\n",
    "1. Person in a hole (fall-rise)\n",
    "1. Icarus (rise-fall)\n",
    "1. Cinderella (rise-fall-rise)\n",
    "1. Oedipus (fall-rise-fall)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we'll pick a book from NLTK and do this. (Note that NLTK, by providing digitized copies of many books, has saved us a _lot_ of effort here.) \n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting more books\n",
    "There are about 30 books available from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) via NLTK. There are *many* more available, though. Those books are accessible from a Python package [`gutenberg`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Gutenberg). Unfortunately, that package is dependent on an Oracle DB package (BSD-DB), which is a hassle to load. For now, let's roll with NLTK.  \n",
